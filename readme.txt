Fun-With-Gravity by Stephen Surtees

This was built on python 2.7 and took just under 10 hours to make

I made this demo specifically as an example for zero light with
very tight time constraints. 

There are lots of things I would have liked to do but I simply didn't have time.
When an asteroid collides with a planet, I would like to turn the planet into a dynamicBody
and in turn fly off and cause chaos :)
